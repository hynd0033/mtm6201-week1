        <p>My name is Conner Hyndman. I was born in Ottawa, Ontario and
        currently live in Russell, Ontario. I am in my first year and second
        term at Algonquin College. I do not like to try new things or go out of
        my comfort zone, but I know I need to, so I push myself every day. I do
        enjoy playing many sports. I go to the gym to lift weights a couple of
        times a week and participate in team sports throughout the seasons. I
        want to be a good person for my family and friends now and in the
        future.</p>
